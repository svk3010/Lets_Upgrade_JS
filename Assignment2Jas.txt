
1. What is the value of clothes[0] and why?
const clothes = ['jacket', 't-shirt'];
clothes.length = 0;
console.log(clothes[0]);
solution: jacket
As array index always start from 0.
So clothes[0] gives us jacket.


2. Write a Javascript program to find the sum of all elements of a given array?
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<script>
var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    var s = 0,
    var i;
for (i = 0; i < array.length; i += 1) 
   {
    s += array[i];
    }
console.log('Sum : '+s );
</script>
</body>
</html>
